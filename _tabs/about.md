Yuzheng Cai is a PhD candidate at School of Data Science, Fudan University, advised by Dr. [Weiguo Zheng](https://weiguozheng.github.io/).
He obtained a B.S. in Data Science from Fudan University in 2021.
His research focuses on graph-related information retrieval, including

- Graph-based vector similarity search (approximate nearest neighbor search, ANNS)
- Graph-based retrieved-augmented generation (RAG)
- Graph data query processing
